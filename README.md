This project was created to showcase the skills learnt in the DA-5020 Collecting Storing and Retrieving Data Course in the Spring 2017 Semester.
The main aim of this project was to identify the errors in the data and tidy them as much as possible.
After tidying the data, creating a SQL database and storing the data in it.
